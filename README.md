# Knights Travails

## Description

This project is part of The Odin Project - Full Stack JavaScript Path. The main
goal is to implement graph and breadth-first search and use it to solve a real
world problem.

## Technologies

JavaScript
Npm
Git

## Assignment

Your task is to build a function knightMoves that shows the shortest possible way
to get from one square to another by outputting all squares the knight will stop
on along the way.

-   Put together a script that creates a game board and a knight.
-   Treat all possible moves the knight could make as children in a tree. Donâ€™t
    allow any moves to go off the board.
-   Decide which search algorithm is best to use for this case. Hint: one of them
    could be a potentially infinite series.
-   Use the chosen search algorithm to find the shortest path between the starting
    square (or node) and the ending square.
